However, for URLs which use the\n scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\n server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n   value in binary format, or produce an error.\n * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n   breaking changes.)\n\n Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official\n protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\n type.googleapis.com.\n\n Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\n used with implementation specific semantics."

If other gateways exist which point to the same proxy,\n Gloo will join them together.\n\n Proxies have a one-to-many relationship with Envoy bootstrap configuration.\n In order to connect to Gloo, the Envoy bootstrap configuration sets a `role` in\n the [node metadata](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/core/base.proto#envoy-api-msg-core-node)\n Envoy instances announce their `role` to Gloo, which maps to the  `{{ .Namespace }}~{{ .Name }}`\n of the Proxy resource.\n\n The template for this value can be seen in the [Gloo Helm chart](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/install/helm/gloo/templates/9-gateway-proxy-configmap.yaml#L22)\n\n Note: this field also accepts fields written in camel-case. They will be converted\n to kebab-case in the Proxy name. This allows use of the [Gateway Name Helm value](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/master/install/helm/gloo/values-gateway-template.yaml#L47)\n for this field\n\n Defaults to `[\"gateway-proxy\"]`"
